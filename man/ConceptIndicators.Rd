\title{Concepts indicators of a Social Cognitive Map}
\usage{
ConceptIndicators(project, filters = NULL, units = "all", weighted.icm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{A QDA project, a list as generated by the ProjectCMap function.}

\item{filters}{A list of named strings that will filter the relationships showed in the SCM. e.g. =list(coding_class = "A_coding_class", document_part = "A_document_part")=. To date, these filters are linked to the nature of relationships.}

\item{units}{A string vector giving the names of the units (i.e. classes linked to documents) that will be include in the SCM. It is a second type of filter.}

\item{weighted.icm}{A boolean. If FALSE, the weight of the relationships in the ICM will be fixed to 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the value of some indicators linked to vertices of a map.
}
\description{
Compute the indicators of concepts of a Social Cognitive Map
}
\details{
Compute the indicators of concepts of a Social Cognitive Map (centrality, indegree, outdegree). It build a user friendly data frame. It includes the 'receiver' and the transmitter character of each vetex. The receiver character of a concept is calculated as the part of the indegree of this concept on its centrality. The transmitter character of a concept is calculated as the part of the outdegree of this concept on its centrality.
